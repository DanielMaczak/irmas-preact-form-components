## Features

Set of minimalistic form components with a simple premise: maximum features in minimum code.

- Independent: Preact is the only dependency.
- Modern: ES6 modules only.
- Clean: 100% in strict TypeScript.
- Easy to use: HTML components finally working as you would expect.
- No fighting: Formating reset to 0, ready to be injected with styles.
- _(Planned) Tiny: Smallest build size achievable._

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Will be added after first full release

## Requirements

I am developing in Preact version 10.19.

## Use case

> [!NOTE]
> Will be added after first full release

## Planned additions

Following is the list of planned features:

- Parent form component: with presets for different use-cases.
- Size optimization: in the spirit of Preact push the build size to the absolute minimum.
- Testing: 100% coverage.
- Browser compatibility and accessibility: ensure uniform functionality across all major browsers.
- Maybe more HTML Input flavors if I see a good case for improvement.
